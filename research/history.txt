History of the Video Synthesizer - 

1924 - 
Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné - (https://baranoff-rossine.com/biography/) - "In 1924 he had the first presentation of his Optophonic Piano during a performance at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow – a synaesthetic instrument that was capable of creating coloured lights, patterns and textures simultaneously." It used painted glass discs which rotated as light passed through them.
